## As you know that YOLO(You Only Look Once) is real time object detection algorithm.

## Here you use YOLOv2.

## Here you can implement this by own just follow this.

### Step1: Dependencies
1.python 3.6 ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)chose 3.6.0).
2.OpenCV([downloas](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)).
3.tensorflow (If you have gpu then use gpu [version](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/))
